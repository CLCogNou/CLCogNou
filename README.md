# Hi, I’m Oziel Román here as: @CLCogNou 👋

## 👀 About Me
I’m a Biomedical Engineer with a Master's in Neuroengineering and Rehabilitation. Currently, I am a PhD Candidate in Biomedical Engineering, focusing on Human-Machine Interfaces (HMIs) utilizing EEG and EMG.
My primary interest lies in developing technologies for rehabilitation.

## 🌱 Current Learning
I’m continually expanding my knowledge in the field of Human-Machine Interfaces, particularly in the use of EEG and EMG for control of devices and interfaces, including video games.
I'm also diving deeper into machine learning, Artifical Intelligence and signal processing to enhance the capabilities of these interfaces.

## 💞️ Collaboration
I’m looking to collaborate on projects related to Human-Machine Interfaces, especially those aimed at rehabilitation technologies.
If you're working on innovative HMI projects or have ideas for new applications of EEG and EMG, I'd love to hear from you!
